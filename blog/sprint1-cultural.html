          <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
          <h2>Values</h2>
          <p>
            I did a bit of research for questions to ask myself and topics to
            consider, in order to find out what my values are. This is a
            difficult topic for me, because while there are immediate things
            that come to mind, I have always felt that in a lot of ways I don’t
            really know who I am and that I’m still figuring it out - I’m
            constantly learning new things about myself. Probably the last time
            I solidly reflected on my values was in my final years at high
            school for some homework task. This is what I came up with as my
            core personal values, and why:
          </p>
          <p>
            Connection - I value the times I’m able to feel a connection with
            myself. Above all though, I value the connection with people I love,
            friends, and even strangers as being a vital part of my life and
            making me who I am today. I consider myself a bit of an introverted
            extrovert; I need to get out and see my friends and socialise, but
            at the same time without some solid time alone to be entirely by
            myself I cannot recharge either. In my mid this comes back to
            connection, the connection to self and others. The connection I have
            and feel with people 100% influences how I feel in life, and brings
            me a great happiness. The best memories I have, the most immediate
            ones that pop to mind are all to do with spending quality time with
            the people important to me and building a deep bond by talking and
            sharing in honesty. I think I feel this way because to me connection
            is what makes us human.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honesty - Without honesty I wouldn’t have the best relationships
            that I have made in my life. I wouldn’t have grown as a person and
            learnt about others that matter to me. I think honestly is key, we
            need to understand our strengths as well as our shortcomings. It can
            be tough to be honest, especially when it hurts our ego or pride,
            but that is especially why I value it. I also think it is the most
            important quality in our connections with each other in creating
            bonds, and is the foundation of respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experiences - This sounds a little vague at first, but to clarify
            I’m talking about experiencing things outside of our norm. For
            instance, moving out from home or to a foreign country, creating
            something, failing at something. Experience is the cornerstone of
            what makes us all unique; all our experiences are different even if
            they can be similar at times, and this is why it is so important to
            me. My experiences have pushed me outside of my comfort zone and
            posed my boundaries in for both the better and worst. Ultimately it
            is how I think we learn about ourselves and to open our eyes to what
            is around us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Work ethic / Effort - In my mind and experience there is no
            substitute for work ethic and actually putting in the effort. I have
            seen people turn their life around and build something out of
            nothing through simply hard work and effort. It is something that
            can be developed, but this also ironically requires the effort to do
            so. This is something that I am constantly working towards
            developing in myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acceptance - For the longest time I never really felt accepted, and
            I think in part a large part of this was also not knowing myself all
            that well too and I didn’t have the confidence to be myself. This is
            not necessarily that people weren’t accepting but rather that I
            might not have been aware. I think this is why it is important to
            me. I remember vividly the realisation and the feeling and happiness
            of being accepted by a friend. This is what makes us feel free to be
            individual, and is where I think our greatest strengths. Being an
            accepting person as well as being accepted means we are able to
            embrace the differences and share a connection. I try to encourage
            this attitude in myself and to see it reflected in others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Individuality - This ties in with acceptance. Having the confidence
            to be individual and not change yourself to suit other people is
            something that I have always struggled with. People who are able to
            do that are the ones I really admire. I know we all have our own
            self-doubts, but I often find myself very self critical. I have
            learned that we can’t change everyone and that at times you just
            have to be yourself regardless of whether people will accept it or
            not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creativity - I think creativity is the manifestation of our
            individuality. They are so linked that without one you almost
            couldn't have the other. It offers a way for us to express our
            individuality and that is why I value it. There can never be a right
            or wrong when it comes to creativity, it just is.
          </p>
          <p>
            I arrived at these values by asking myself about times that have
            made me the happiest, times I felt satisfied in life or fulfilled,
            moment I felt the most proud, and lastly the people I love and
            admire most. I asked myself other questions along with the above,
            such as who was there, what other factors influenced the feeling and
            so.
          </p>
          <h2>Identity</h2>
          <p>
            I think my very European family has likely influence my values and
            identity more than I realised when I was young. Everyone is very
            family orientated, and my grandparents are central figures in the
            family. They came from growing up in WWII with nothing, and then
            moved to NZ with nothing and built their lives from scratch. I this
            has made an intrenched attitude of appreciation and a lack of regard
            for wealth as being important. Overall probably a hard work ethic
            and determination are common values in the family. Growing up
            amongst this, being very close with my grandparents and seeing the
            people around me act in this way undoubtedly influenced the was I
            act and think. I think also the fact that we eat certain Dutch
            foods, speak some words and frequently have relatives over to NZ to
            visit has also instilled a feeling or being dutch, although I’ve
            never actually been there and hardly speak the language.
          </p>
          <h2>Strengths</h2>
          <p>
            I think my main strengths are my work ethic, determination and
            awareness. I have a deep motivation to accomplish what I set my mind
            to and this drives me through doing things and completing them right
            until the end. I don’t like to leave things unfinished. I also have
            a keen awareness of others and how they feel, where they struggle,
            and I think this allows me to work well with anybody - I can
            honestly say I don’t think I’ve every been in a situation where work
            or study has been tough because of interpersonal tensions. However I
            am always very self critical, and this can set me back at times and
            I doubt myself and struggle to find the motivation or drive if I get
            in my head. Also because of this I struggle to take any form of
            praise or complement, but on the flip side tend to value
            constructive criticism more. For some reason in my head it feel more
            practical, and I tend to have my doubts that positive feedback is
            genuine at times. I think my strength will definitely be an asset on
            this learning journey as learning anything new require a lot of
            effort and hardwork. 
            <p>
            The only instance I can think of where there
            was a tension, was in my last job. I had been working there for 3
            years along with my colleague. We were working on a project to
            retrofit some equipment, and the method he proposed seemed totally
            illogical to me. I politely offered my method to the group as an
            alternative, at which point my colleague insisted that his was the
            right way to go and that was that, end of discussion. I handled this
            by simply removing myself from the situation because I was aware
            that there was something going on here with him where he felt he
            needed it done his way. Maybe he felt he had something to prove, or
            disagreed with my suggestion, which is fine either way, but I
            recognised that then and there was not the time to discuss it. I
            waited a day or so for the tension to die down, before trying to
            discuss this again. At this time things were more calm and we had a
            discussion coming to a compromise. I think this is the nature of
            people, we all have lives and who knows what is influencing or
            affecting someone at any given time, but recognising this and having
            awareness of others helps.
