          <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
         <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>I would like to become a junior web developer after graduating from Dev Academy, and to one day have enough skills and experience to be able to work remotely. My dream would be to be able to work remotely so that I could easily travel to visit family - my family is very international and with my previous career getting any amount of time to go overseas was difficult. </p>
        <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
      </h2>
      <p>I would like to be able to better manage my own time and ability to plan out and see through the tasks I set - time management. To better take both positive and negative feedback and turn it into something contructive. Also to learn how to work as a part of a team of developers through pair-coding challenges and the like.</p>
      <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations
      </h2>
      <p>My main strength are my determination, and awareness. I can be very determined to complete whatever it is I set my mind to, and I have a good awareness of other I work with. My limitations would be that I stuggle to confront issues a times, and I don't have the best time management skills.</p>
      <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
      </h2>
      <p>I will plan out my days and stick to the plan as best I can. Where i cannot, I will make up for ths the following day. I will make sure I use the toggl app to track my time and make improvements on my effiencies. Where I find or have any issues I will do my best to speak up and seek advice fo¥rom my peers and facilitator.</p>
      <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h2>
      <p>I will reach out on slack to my facilitator or peers depending on what it is I need help for, and will make sure to do it on the same day that I need the assistance.</p>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
      <p>Support when required, I suppose. Someone to reach out to for advice and any tips on working through the foundations course, and perhaps just someone to vocalise thoughts outloud to about the course to during catchups.</p>
      <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>
  <p>I have classes blocked out on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday for Jiu Jitsu. Additionally two hour minimum each night to spend relaxing with my fiance.</p>
