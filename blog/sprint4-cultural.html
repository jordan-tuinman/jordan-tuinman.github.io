        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
        <p>
          The ability for the brain to change over a lifetime. It is the ability to change its structure and function in
          response to what we experience. In other words out ability to develop and learn new skills and knowledge. This
          is most often achieved by repeating an activity or even accessing a memory to strengthen that skill or
          knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>Understanding how this works gives us the tools necessary to develop ourselves, and know that we can in fact
          learn and change the way we think and our abilities to do something. With understanding is the realisation
          that our brains are not in some static state, and through some repetition and conscious effort we can increase
          our abilities.
        </p>
        <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
        <p>
          I think the key one here is repetition, and actively thinking about what it is I want to develop in my mind. I
          know that this works from past experience, as I am fluent in Japanese as a non-native speaker. I spent many
          years studying and trying to develop something I never thought I could achieve at first, but by actively
          putting in effort and focusing on the small successes I realised things were changing and I was improving. It
          may be a long road sometimes but it is perfectly doable. This is particularly relevant in my current journey,
          learning programming with Dev Academy. It has been some time since my language study and it is now something
          that seems so normal to me, but in the same way I have to remind myself and focus on putting in active effort
          and to focus on the small successes. Its the journey, not the destination as they say, and I think it’s
          important to reflect on the small steps because that's how we can measure our progress in a productive
          motivating way.
        </p>
        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
          The best way is through a conscious effort to repeat an activity or actively thinking (accessing a memory), or
          other method to review the material in which we are trying to develop neuroplasticity. Performing something
          multi-sensory is a good way to achieve this because you are using several different parts of your brain. For
          instance playing sport or music, speaking a language. These things can help increase brain plasticity, and by
          doing actions like this this we start to build better, stronger connection to these activities in the brain.
        </p>
        <h2>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging</h2>
        <p>
          I found <a class="blog-link"
            href="https://www.mindlabpro.com/blogs/nootropics/neuroplasticity-rewire-your-brain-for-learning-memory-and-mood">this</a>
          blog post to be quite interesting, as it summarises the topic pretty well and give some interesting examples
          of neuroplasticity. Also it cites where a lot of the information comes from so it was a good place to also
          find further resources.
        </p>
        <h2>Discuss what Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant?</h2>
        <p>
          I think growth mindset ties in very similarly with neuroplasticity, as it is about understanding that you can
          grow and develop your mind, that it is not a fixed thing with no room for change. By having a growth mindset,
          we can increase our neuroplasticity. To further elaborate, the growth mindset is about seeking out challenges
          and engaging with them, then knowing that failure is not a weakness but an opportunity to learn and develop.
          It is a way to further stretch our abilities and knowledge but realising our limitations, accepting them, and
          then striving to learn and overcome.
        </p>
        <p>It is also important to realise that we might have a growth mindset in some areas, but in others have a fixed
          mindset. A fixed mindset is where we see ourselves and our knowledge, our abilities, as static. That they may
          hit a glass ceiling and that is where they will stay because that is the way we are - no room for improvement
          or development.
        </p>
        <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
        <p>
          For me, I had never thought about the idea that we might have a growth mindset in some areas and not others.
          The growth mindset idea was so central to my role when I worked in Microsoft, however I think myself and
          others I worked with there only really applied it in the workplace because it was a workplace ideal. Looking
          at this now I see that it’s something so logical, but I just hadn’t considered that in other areas I may not
          be applying it. This has given me a new view on myself and my actions for sure, because off the top of my head
          I can immediately think of many areas where I have a fixed mindset.
        </p>
        <h2>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
          As I was saying the previously question, I think I made a realisation that I have been quite fixed in my
          mindset of myself in certain areas and that I haven’t been very open. This is where I will have to make a
          conscious effort to apply a growth mindset. I have to actively consider where I have been thinking in a fixed
          way and try to change that. By do so I believe I can develop myself further in the direction I want to be
          heading career-wise and in life.
