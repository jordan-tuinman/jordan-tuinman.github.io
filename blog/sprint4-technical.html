        <h1>A problem solving reflection</h1>
        <h2>Coding problems and how I get unblocked</h2>
        <p>
          I really struggled with the challenge to find Scooby. I wrote out so many versions of code to try to retieve
          the correct door number for the object where scooby was 'hiding'. It took until I went back and revised my
          psuedocode that I realised I was missing a key step in the process and that I hadn't properly understood what
          I needed to do to achieve a solution. I was getting stuck returning the entire object, and not just the
          property needed, ie. the door number. By taking the time go back over my
          pusedocode and carefully explain to myself outloud what I needed to do, I reaslised I was missing something
          quite simple but important from the function to ensure it would output the correct result - I wasn't
          calling the door property correctly... I didn't realise that we can call a property on top of a variable which
          I had previously expressed in the function, which I found out by googling how I could
          retrieve the propery I needed. Once I added this into what I was trying to return, everything pieced together
          nicely.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess in short, I solved my own problem by pausing for a minute to ensure that I understood the problem
          correctly, and then revised the steps in my solution from there to find what was missing.
        </p>
        <h1>Problem solving techniques reflection</h1>
        <h2>Psuedocode</h2>
        <p>
          I find psuedocode to be very helpful as I have something immediately visible to refer back to and see whether
          or not I am roughly on the right track. I tried to use it as a guide to note down what outcome I need to
          achieve, and what key features I think I will need to do so. The way I was writing it, I felt made sense to me
          but probably I could do better to write something a bit more universally friendly - I tend to like short key
          words as prompts so my psuedocode may be looking a bit sparing to some.
        </p>
        <h2>Tring something</h2>
        <p>
          This is a go to for me at this point in my learning journey. I find that I'm learning a lot througha and often
          achieving my desired result through just trying something - trial and error. I think for me I often find it
          helps to throw something at the wall and what sticks ans what didn't, then go from there.
        </p>
        <h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
        <p>
          This has also always been a go to for me through out my working life as well, not just in coding but also when
          I used to work troubleshooting a lot fo hardware based issues. I often talk outloud about what need to do to
          solve a problem, or what steps I have taken so far, starting at the most basic parts. More recently since
          starting this course studying at home, I have been talking to my dog.. Just hope she doesn't ever start to
          talk back, then it might be time for a break.
        </p>
        <h2>Reading error messages</h2>
        <p>
          I've found this very helpful to understand whats going wrong, but only when I actually know what the error
          message means. Sounds silly but for instance at first I didn't know that when using the find method on an
          array that it may return as undefined when false, so at first I was very confused why I kept getting undefined
          returned i
          the console. I think if you have a good understanding of what you might expect as an error for each statement
          then it gives a good indication of where to look in your code to solve it. At this point for me, it usually is
          just telling me that theres something wrong which makes me think "oh..".
        </p>
        <h2>Console.logging</h2>
        <p>
          I find myself doing this all the time to see what I'm actually achieving as I work. This is probably one of
          the most helpful problem solvong techniques for me. I used the console.log in nearly every challenge on
          REPL.IT.
        </p>
        <h2>Googling</h2>
        <p>
          For now I google all the time. I feel like there is so much, too much to try to memorise and that overall I
          still have an avergae understanding of what I am doing. I definitely rely on google a lot to find answers to
          questions I have and to better understand something that I'm trying to do at the time. I have due to this
          gotten better at googling specifically what it is I need answered though, so that's a bonus I suppose.
        </p>
        <h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
        <p>
          I haven't asked many peers for help at this point. Although I know I definitely will in the coming weeks at
          Dev Academy. It's something I am very comfortable with doing, but up to this point haven't felt the need.
        </p>
        <h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
        <p>
          Again, something I feel perfectly comfortable doing but haven't yet had much discussions. For I will be doing
          this more oftern as the course proceeds.
        </p>
        <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I find that with learning to develop it is something that I need to do often but I'm not very good at it. It's
          taken me a little while to figure out that if I want to reflect properly on what I'm doing I need to take a
          break completely removed from the situation and be alone for a short while with no tech. Maybe take my dog for
          a walk. Once I come back I can usually see things a bit clearer and re-evaluate what I was doing and how I
          might improve on it.
