        <h2>The Differences between HTML and CSS - an analogy
        </h2>
        <p>
          HTML is used to create the structure of our webpage. It is made up of elements, and inside these we may insert
          other elements. It can be used to create a hierarchical structure in this way, in which the parent element may
          affect the child element. HTML is only intended to be used to structure and layout a web page. To style it we
          use CSS.
        </p>
        <p>CSS is not made up of elements. It is code that is used to modify the HTML elements. We can do this by
          targeting a range of elements, or even one specifically depending on whether we target the element type, or
          the class and the id assigned to elements. This is how we style a web page. The HTML hierarchy also comes into
          play here, as if we style a parent, the child element is also styled accordingly unless otherwise specified.
          Not unlike how actual children tend to look like their parents; certain aspects are passed on.
        </p>
        <h2>Control flow and loops explained
        </h2>
        <p>
          A control flow is simply the order in which code is executed in a script, and a loop is the looping of this
          code until a condition is no longer true. For example, you might be cooking a roast leg of lamb - the steps
          involved in this would be your control flow. You may have to defrost the lamb, preheat the oven, prepare the
          lamb, season it, put it in the oven, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>Where the loop might kick in is perhaps when you are checking if it is done. You may set a timer and check
          the state of the lamb after 2 hours, and then if the lamb is still not done, check again every subsequent
          15min until done. This act of checking and re-checking until done would be the loop. The loops starts at the
          2hour mark and you check to see if the lamb is still not done - true. So you loop the cooking process another
          15min and check again; is the lamb still not done - false. The loop now ends because our basis of our loop is
          no longer true.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the DOM and how do we interact with it?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The DOM is the Document Object Model. It is a representation of the hierarchical structure of our web page.
          Think of is as a tree with branches spreading out and separating for each node and subsequent nested node. We
          use the DOM to add, change and delete by accessing it with JavaScript.

        </p>
        <h2>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
        </h2>
        <p>
          Arrays are a collection of values indicated by square brackets ( [ ] ). Each item of data in the array is
          indexed, starting with 0 onwards. We can reference this index to pull forward and use values listed in the
          array.
        </p>
        <p>With objects, we indicate what the properties by using curly brackets ( { } ). Each item listed in the curly
          brackets is a property, which we can assign a value. When calling on a property from the object, we reference
          it by using the object names and dot-notation or bracket notation to call the property.
        </p>
        <h2>What are functions are why are they useful?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A function is a set of statements (code) that is used to do a specific task. We can name the function, and it
          works by passing in parameters, and then specifying what it needs to do. Essentially it takes some inputs and
          returns an output, like calculating a value.
          This is useful because a function can be reused as many times as you like.
