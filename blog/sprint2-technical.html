          <h1>Inline vs Inline-block</h1>
          <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
          <p>
            To explain what this means and what the difference is, I think we
            first need to understand the basic rules of three display property
            types: block, inline, and inline-block.
          </p>
          <p>
            Block elements respect margins of other elements, meaning that this
            can and will move them around the page depending on the margin
            settings. They also force line break so that no other element can
            sit beside them, only above or below. Examples of block elements are
            paragraphs, headings, and lists.
          </p>
          <p>
            An inline element means that the element will allow other elements
            to sit beside it on the left or right - inline. The inline elements
            respect left and right margins, but top and bottom margins are
            ignored. They can not have a width or height set, they just are how
            they are - the width depending on the content inside. Examples of
            inline elements are spans, inputs, and labels.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inline-block elements are a sort of combination of the two; the best
            of both worlds in a sense, depending on the intended use. We must
            set this property, and it gives us a way to adjust the width and
            height on elements that otherwise we couldn’t. This also will let us
            put boxes side by side and wrap them if there is adequate space in
            the container, because they do not force a line break unlike a
            regular block element. So, essentially it is the same as a inline
            element except we can set te width and height. It is literally an
            inline block element, hence the name.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the image below you can see some examples of elements with each
            of the above display properties, which should give an idea about how
            they appear on a page:

          />
        </div>
