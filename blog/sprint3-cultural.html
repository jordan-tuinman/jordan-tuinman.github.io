          <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
          <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is the ability to consider what we are thinking and feeling, your emotions, and to use this in a positive way to communicate, act and empathise with others. You would consider what your emotions, and the same for someone else and then act upon it - taking that information into consideration and being aware of it. This is also know as being mindful - mindfulness.
          </p>
          <h2>How is it different from IQ?
        </h2>
        <p>IQ is a measure of one’s intelligence or problem solving skills - someones logic and reasoning ability. This is vastly different from EQ which is the consideration of emotion. EQ is about yourself and others around you, IQ is a measure purely about the individual and does not have any consideration of the individuals emotional state. </p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>Well since EQ is about an awareness or mindfulness of emotion, it can impact on how we deal with others around us, and even how we deal with ourselves. We may notice certain trends in the way we think or feel and then can adjust and improve upon ourselves accordingly. Perhaps take a break and simply know what we are like, what trends we have - having this individual awareness could be very beneficial in improving our emotional state.</p> 
        <p>This also will importantly affect the way we deal with others - being able to be aware of how people feel, what they might be thinking could help us in communicating ideas and clarifying issues both personal and professional. By doing so we could create stronger bonds and be able to more smoothly have working relationships, by having an understanding that everyone is different and handles things differently. </p>
