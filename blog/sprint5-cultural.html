        <h1>Core Learning Reflections</h1>
        <h2>
          What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I learned that my expectations for myself are often too high, or rather that I am too harsh on my learning
          speed. In line with this, I learned that the way I think and learn, and my concentration has changed a lot
          from my university days. This is something that has been something of an adjustment. Lastly I would say I
          learned that my ego rears its head when it comes time to reflect on work. I learned that reflecting on my work
          brings out a lot of pride in what I do well, and a lot of disappointment when I struggle, to the point that I
          feel bogged down at times.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programmingWhat has surprised you the
          most about the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The fact that I feel like it was valuable, where at first I was doubting how much I might actually get out of
          it. I feel like it showed me a lot about myself and taught me about the way I think, and pointed to areas
          where I can make improvement. I’m alllll about self improvement.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          For me it would be being open with other people; putting my thoughts and feelings about the tasks up on a blog
          where anyone can read it was a weird experience. Also analysing myself and looking at my values and strengths
          was quite tough for me. It was something I don’t know if I’ve ever done properly before so it was a challenge
          to even get started.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
          development bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          People skills are a huge part of working in a team, and as a programmer we will need to be working with other
          people in the day to day whether it is colleagues or clients. Developing our core skills gives us more
          awareness of ourselves and of others, so as to improve our communication and relationships with them.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
          time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
          No, it doesn’t feel like a waste of time. I feel like it was surprisingly useful for me, even if I would have
          rather spent that time coding at times. I think it was valuable because it taught me a lot about myself and it
          got me to reflect on who I am and how I do things - something which I haven’t taken the time to do before, or
          at the very least haven’t done as effectively until now. Now that I think I have a better understanding of
          myself it has helped with the way in which I approach everything from study to problem solving and
          communicating with people in a more effective way. Moreover I now feel that I can continue developing the
          tools I need to succeed because I have more of an idea of what works for me and what doesn’t.
