        <h1>Core Learning Reflections</h1>
        <h2>
          What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I learned that my expectations for myself are often too high, or rather that I am too harsh on my learning
          speed. In line with this, I learned that the way I think and learn, and my concentration has changed a lot
          from my university days. This is something that has been something of an adjustment. Lastly I would say I
          learned that my ego rears its head when it comes time to reflect on work. I learned that reflecting on my work
          brings out a lot of pride in what I do well, and a lot of disappointment when I struggle, to the point that I
          feel bogged down at times.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programmingWhat has surprised you the
          most about the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The fact that I feel like it was valuable, where at first I was doubting how much I might actually get out of
          it. I feel like it showed me a lot about myself and taught me about the way I think, and pointed to areas
          where I can make improvement. I’m alllll about self improvement.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          For me it would be being open with other people; putting my thoughts and feelings about the tasks up on a blog
          where anyone can read it was a weird experience. Also analysing myself and looking at my values and strengths
          was quite tough for me. It was something I don’t know if I’ve ever done properly before so it was a challenge
          to even get started.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
          development bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          People skills are a huge part of working in a team, and as a programmer we will need to be working with other
          people in the day to day whether it is colleagues or clients. Developing our core skills gives us more
          awareness of ourselves and of others, so as to improve our communication and relationships with them.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
          time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
          No, it doesn’t feel like a waste of time. I feel like it was surprisingly useful for me, even if I would have
          rather spent that time coding at times. I think it was valuable because it taught me a lot about myself and it
          got me to reflect on who I am and how I do things - something which I haven’t taken the time to do before, or
          at the very least haven’t done as effectively until now. Now that I think I have a better understanding of
          myself it has helped with the way in which I approach everything from study to problem solving and
          communicating with people in a more effective way. Moreover I now feel that I can continue developing the
          tools I need to succeed because I have more of an idea of what works for me and what doesn’t.
        </p>

        <h1>Updated Learning Plan & Reflections</h1>
        <h2>
          What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I’m hoping to learn and gather enough skills to land a job as a junior developer once this course is over. I would like to feel confident in what I have learned and proud of the work I’ve done. In the future, I would ideally like to once day be able to work for myself, or work remotely. Also to be able to make websites and web apps for family and friends, or help those who need it.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think largely this remains the same as what I had originally noted. I think I have a good awareness in general and this is extending and improving in terms of my self awareness, and I still am very determined to accomplish what I need to. I think these will be beneficial in the bootcamp because I no matter how things are on the day to day, I have the drive to make it through to the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my limitations remains some time management issues, but I feel it is improving overall. I also have discovered that I get overwhelmed with my learning journey at times, more than I originally expected, and it’s taking me time to learn how to deal with and overcome it. I’m anticipating these limitation may be barriers at times, so I’m trying to make a plan to deal with it and know how to deal with myself at these times. For instance, regular reflection and breathers.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Definitely staying on tope of the material is what I’m most worried about. I don’t want to fall behind or allow myself to get stuck falling down rabbit holes of information. I think it will be a big challenge for me to plan out my week efficiently and to keep on top of the materials, but I believe I can do it. 
        </p>
        <h2>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I would like to work further on my time management skills, as I still feel like I’m learning and developing a good way to deal with this in regards to coding work and needing regular breaks. Also I know that I need work on how I deal with stress and feeling overwhelmed, with a part of this being reflection on work and learnings. Overall, I think my self-awareness has improved but now I feel that it’s utilising that for greater change. 
        </p>
        <h2>
          What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
        </h2>
        <p>
          I’m expecting myself to keep onto of the material through effective planning and organisation, as well as effectively taking breaks and giving myself room to breathe where I can. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I will likely be seeking help from my peers daily with collaborating on troubling material, via slack because I’m on the online cohort. If possible, maybe even meet up in person with someone working in the same city to work on things. I will also be asking my tech-in facilitators for help and  advice before something drags on to become a problem. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To effectively work in a productive way I will have to set a strict schedule with set breaks, and a plan with timelines. I have a whiteboard on my wall for planning out my days/week, and to write notes for to do lists. Also, plenty of post-it note reminders and to do’s on my monitor!
